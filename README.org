This project builds itself using net.didierverna.clon: if you can load
the asdf system, the function [[file:main.lisp::defun dump]] will create a
standalone binary with all the dependencies. The arguments to this
binary can be found via the =--help= switch or by looking at
[[file:main.lisp::defsynopsis]].  For now, all this does is watch stacks
that are in transitioning stages (=--watch=) and exits when they are
done, showing the parameters passed to the stack and the outputs it
returns.
